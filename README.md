A framework to measure the perceptual performance of Optogenetic Proteins:
A MATLAB implementation to measure Contrast Sensitivity Function(CSF) using Psychophysics. This is an established metric to measure the acuity of human vision.
With this experiment, we can also replicate the visual perception of 'virtual patients' with optogenetic proteins. Think of it as virtual prototyping for optogenetic visual prosthetics.
The interface to run the experiment is runExperiment.m
