This repo contains a MATLAB implementation of a Psychophysics experiment to measure Contrast Sensitivity Function(CSF) of participants. This is an established metric for visual acuity.
Using this, we can also modify the stimuli to replicate the visual perception of stimuli of a 'virtual patients' with optogenetic proteins.
The interface to run the experiment is runExperiment.m
